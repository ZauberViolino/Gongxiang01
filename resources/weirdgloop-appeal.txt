I had been blocked on the Minecraft Chinese wiki, but it block is a wrongfully and rudely.
I only on the Admin noticeboard(管理员告示板) use a demo to report a AbuseFilter bug, this bug I used a word "Miniworld"(迷你世界), so I blocked Infinity.
But only a time it blocked is wrongfully and against the rule.
I can't to appeal so I need you help.
